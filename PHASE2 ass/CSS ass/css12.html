        <h1>The History of 'Doctor'
            Just who qualifies as a doctor anyway?</h1>

    <p>What to Know
        Doctor comes from the Latin word for "teacher" and originally referred to a small group of theologians who had
        approval from the Church to speak on religious matters. Eventually the term saw greater use referring to
        qualified academic and medical professionals.

        It's a familiar trope in television and movies: someone has an emergency medical need in a public setting far
        from medical care. A loud call is heard: "We need doctor! Is there a doctor in the house?"
        The English language history of doctor starts in the early 14th century, when the word was first applied to a
        select few who likely knew neither bloodwork nor basketwork. They were equipped for dealing with matters of the
        soul: they were eminent theologians who had a special seal of approval from the Roman Catholic Church as people
        able to talk about and explain the doctrines of the Church. They were teachers of a kind, and the word's origin
        makes this connection. The word doctor comes from the Latin word for "teacher," itself from docÄ“re, meaning "to
        teach."
        The 14th century was the birth of the Renaissance, and lots of teaching and learning was afoot. By the century's
        end, the word doctor was being applied not just to a select few theologians, but also to qualified and/or
        accomplished academics and medical practitioners.

        In the centuries between then and now, doctor has had many other applications, including referencing a soldering
        tool, a tropical sea breeze, and a loaded die. It's almost exclusively used of people now, and both qualified
        academics and medical practitioners may rightfully claim it.</p>
