    <p>A school is both the educational institution and building designed to provide learning spaces and learning
        environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal
        education, which is sometimes compulsory.[2] In these systems, students progress through a series of schools
        that can be built and operated by both government and private organization. The names for these schools vary by
        country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) but generally include primary school for young children
        and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education
        is taught is commonly called a university college or university.</p><br><br>
    <input type="button" class="button" value="COLLEGE">
    <p>A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be a
        degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, an institution
        offering vocational education, a further education institution, or a secondary school.

        In most of the world, a college may be a high school or secondary school, a college of further education, a
        training institution that awards trade qualifications, a higher-education provider that does not have university
        status (often without its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university. In the United
        States, a college may offer undergraduate programs – either as an independent institution or as the
        undergraduate program of a university – or it may be a residential college of a university or a community
        college, referring to (primarily public) higher education institutions that aim to provide affordable and
        accessible education, usually limited to two-year associate degrees.[1] The word is generally also used as a
        synonym for a university in the US.[2] Colleges in countries such as France, Belgium, and Switzerland provide
        secondary education.</p>
