    <center><h2>Artificial intelligence</h2></center>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of
        living beings, primarily of humans. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies
        intelligent machines. Such machines may be called AIs.

        AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications are:
        advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and
        Netflix), interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g.,
        Waymo), generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art), and superhuman play and analysis in strategy
        games (e.g., chess and Go).[1] However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI
        has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful
        enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."[2][3]

        Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine
        intelligence.[4] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[5] The field went
        through multiple cycles of optimism,[6][7] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as
        AI winter.[8][9] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI
        techniques,[10] and after 2017 with the transformer architecture.[11] This led to the AI spring of the early
        2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering
        significant advances in artificial intelligence.[12]

        The growing use of artificial intelligence in the 21st century is influencing a societal and economic shift
        towards increased automation, data-driven decision-making, and the integration of AI systems into various
        economic sectors and areas of life, impacting job markets, healthcare, government, industry, and education. This
        raises questions about the ethical implications and risks of AI, prompting discussions about regulatory policies
        to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.

        The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The
        traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural
        language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence (the ability to complete any
        task performable by a human on an at least equal level) is among the field's long-term goals.[13]

        To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques,
        including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on
        statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy,
        neuroscience and other fields</p>
