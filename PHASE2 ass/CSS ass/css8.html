    <p>Dharamshala is a town in the Indian state of
        Himachal Pradesh. It serves as the winter capital of the state and the administrative headquarters of the Kangra
        district since 1855.[5][6][7] The town also hosts the Tibetan Government-in-exile. Dharamshala was a municipal
        council until 2015, when it was upgraded to a municipal corporation.

        The town is located in the Kangra Valley, in the shadow of the Dhauladhar range of the Himalayas at an altitude
        of 1,457 metres (4,780 ft). References to Dharamshala and its surrounding areas are found in ancient Hindu
        scriptures such as Rig Veda and Mahabharata. The region was under Mughal influence before it was captured by the
        Sikh empire in 1785. The East India Company captured the region for the British following the First Anglo-Sikh
        War of 1846, from when it became part of the British Indian province of the Punjab. Post Indian Independence in
        1947, it remained as a small hill station. In 1960, the Central Tibetan Administration was moved to Dharamshala
        when the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso established the Tibetan administration-in-exile after he had to flee
        Tibet.
        Due to a lack of uniform observance of conventions for Hindi transcription and transliteration of the script
        used to write it, Devanagari, the name of the town has been variously romanised in English and other languages
        as Dharamshala, Dharamsala, Dharmshala and Dharmsala.[10] These four permutations result from two variables: the
        transcription of the word धर्म (dharma)—particularly the second syllable (र्म) and that of the third syllable
        (शा). A strict transliteration of धर्म as written would be 'dharma' [ˈdʱərmə]. In the modern spoken Hindi of the
        region, there is a common metathesis in which the vowel and consonant sounds in the second syllable of certain
        words (including धर्म) are transposed, which changes 'dharma' to 'dharam' pronounced somewhere between [ˈdʱərəm]
        and [ˈdʱərm]. Regarding the third syllable, the Devanagari श corresponds to the English sh sound, [ʃ] and thus
        शाला is transcribed in English as 'shala'. Therefore, the most accurate phonetic transcription of the Hindi
        धर्मशाला into Roman script for common (non-technical) English usage is either 'Dharamshala' or, less commonly,
        'Dharmshala', both of which render the sh (/ʃ/) sound of श in English as 'sh' to convey the correct native
        pronunciation, 'Dharamshala' [dʱərəmˈʃaːlaː] or 'Dharmshala' ([dʱərmˈʃaːlaː]). Regardless of spelling
        variations, the correct native pronunciation is with the sh sound (/ʃ/).[11]

        History
        Early history
        References to Dharamshala and its surrounding areas are found in ancient Hindu scriptures such as Rig Veda and
        Mahabharata.[12] There are mentions of the region by Pāṇini in 4th century BC and by Chinese traveler Heun Tsang
        during the reign of king Harshavardhana in 7th century AD.[13] The indigenous people of the Dharamshala area
        (and the surrounding region) are the Gaddis, a predominantly Hindu group who traditionally lived a nomadic or
        semi-nomadic transhumant lifestyle.[14]

        The region was subject to attacks from Mughal rulers Mahmud of Ghazni in 1009 and Firuz Shah Tughlaq in 1360. In
        1566, Akbar captured the region and brought it under the Mughal rule. As the Mughal rule disintegrated, Sikh
        chieftain Jai Singh brought the region to his control and gave it to Sansar Chand of the Katoch dynasty,
        legitimate Rajput prince in 1785. Gurkhas invaded and captured the region in 1806 before being defeated by
        Ranjit Singh in 1809. The Katoch dynasty was reduced to the status of jagirdars under the treaty of Jawalamukhi
        signed between Chand and Singh in 1810. Post the death of Chand, Ranjit Singh annexed the region into the Sikh
        empire.</p>
